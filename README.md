# Steganography Algorithms and Proposed Method
Some Steganography Algorithms and a Proposed Improved Method for LSB.

Contents:
1. LSB - Naive Implementation
2. LSB - using Linked List Concepts
3. LSB - using K-Means Clustering
4. [LSB Proposed (Improved Method)](https://github.com/DLarisa/Steganography-Algorithms-and-Proposed-Method/tree/main/Algoritm%20Propus%20%2B%20GUI) - using AES and Pixel Sequence (Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm - Durstenfeld's Version)
5. DCT
